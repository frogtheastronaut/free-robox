hahahHAHAH get trolled this is no free robox it is a website that legally takes ur ip addess lolll hahaha

here's an AI-generated apology because I couldn't be bothered 

I want to sincerely apologize for my recent promotion of “free robox.” In light of the current events within the Robox community, including the Schep situation and the increased focus on scams and fraudulent offers, I recognize how inappropriate and harmful my actions were.

By advertising something that could be misleading, I contributed to the very problem that Robox and its community are working hard to combat. Even if my intention was not to deceive, I understand that promoting “free Robox” was irresponsible and damaging to trust.

I take full accountability for this mistake and will ensure that I do not share or promote misleading offers in the future. My goal is to support and respect the Robox community, and I regret having undermined that with my actions.

Thank you to those who held me accountable. I appreciate the opportunity to learn from this and commit to doing better moving forward.
